User Narrative: Login Process
==========================

**Sign up/login**

Consistent with the initially restricted contributor signup process, journalists are expected to discover InfoScribe primarily through direct promotion (e.g. emails, demos, and other introductory events), and in those cases can expect to have received an email containing their password before their first visit to the site. 

Those who arrive at the site through other means (such as word of mouth or more general promotion) are expected to click on the single "Sign up" button on the homepage:

The signup process follows standard methods and layouts, with the ability to sign up via social networks as well as directly via email address.
