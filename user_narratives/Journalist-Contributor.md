User Narrative: Journalist/Contributor
==========================

**Sign up/login**

Consistent with the initially restricted contributor signup process, journalists are expected to discover InfoScribe primarily through direct promotion (e.g. emails, demos, and other introductory events), and in those cases can expect to have received an email containing their password before their first visit to the site. 

Those who arrive at the site through other means (such as word of mouth or more general promotion) are expected to click on the single "Sign up" button on the homepage:

In the signup dialogue, users interested in a contributor login are then redirected to the "Contact" page which contains the contributor signup form.

When the contributor returns to the homepage after an account has been created for them, they are expected to use the "Contributor login" link at the upper right of the screen:

Which will direct direct them to the login dialogue with the "This is a contributor account" selection box already checked:

If the contributor selects the central "Log in" link, however, they will have to check this box manually.

>Note: though the contributor login and scriber login dialogues are identical, they route to different dashboards. For clarity, this currently means that a contributor must sign out of their contributor account in order to sign into their scriber account, if they have one.
