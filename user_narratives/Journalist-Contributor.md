**Creating a new InfoScribe project**

Only users with sufficient privileges can create new InfoScribe projects. Initially, these users will be only approved journalists, though over time, Scribers may gain increased privileges that will allow them to take over and/or create their own InfoScribe projects.

InfoScribe is designed to facilitate the transcription of similar sets of documents. Each document may have one or more pages, but no more than eight (8) fields per project may be specified for transcription. Different sets of data may be transcribed from a single set of documents by creating multiple projects with the same source documents, but contributors are discouraged from asking users to transcribe large blocks of free text as a means around this initial limit (research shows that 8 items is roughly the maximum number of items that most users will complete in a quiz/survey environment). This also helps contributors tie their transcription requests to particular story outcome.

**Uploading documents**

Each document in a given set should have roughly the same layout. Ideally, these documents will either be uploaded from the user's hard drive or selected via a connected DocumentCloud account. In any case, when a new project is created, the Contributor will be prompted to enter a range of metadata, including:

+ published (visible to others and available for transcription) or private (visible only to owner)
+ descriptive project title
+ project description, which should convey to potential scribers *why* the transcription project is important/valuable. For example, the contributor may describe potential story directions possible once the data is transcribed.
+ transcription deadline. This is the date by which the contributor needs the data transcribed in order to be able to meaningfully use it (for example, documents about campaign contributions would probably reasonably need to be transcribed at least several weeks before an election).
+ embargo date. This must be *on* or *after* the transcription deadline, and is the date until which the transcribed data will remain private to the owner of the project. The idea here is to reserve exclusive use of the data for a limited period - sufficient to write and publish the major stories it might generate - but then have the data be accessible to the broader community.

Before the project can be moved to a status of "Published," the Contributor must define the transcription fields for the project, as described below. 

**Defining transcription fields**

After all documents have been uploaded, the contributor will choose one "exemplar document" on which to highlight relevant transcription regions. Upon selecting an exemplar document, the document will be rendered on-screen (in the same layout as the transcription page, but with the fields at right currently empty). By using the mouse to create click-and-drag rectangles over the regions of the document that contain the data to be transcribed, the contributor builds the data schema for the document set (the location and size of these rectangles should also be stored so they can be optionally displayed on the transcription page as "highlights" to guide scribers on roughly where to look for a particular piece of information).

Each time a rectangle is selected, it will be tagged with a visual number and a corresponding numbered data field will appear at right, with a "field name" entry to be entered by the Contributor, and a "data type" to be selected via dropdown. This process is repeated until the desired number of fields (up to the limit of 8 noted above) have been created. (Contributors should obviously have the opportunity to delete and re-order entries as needed until the submit the schema).
